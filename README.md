# VRPNPlayField
This code can be useful for applications that require the storage of spatial tracking and input data in a human-readable format such as XML. This data can then be easily shared, processed, or analyzed by other programs.


To clarify, the code provided earlier is a partial implementation that includes the basic functionality for getting position and button data from VRPN devices and storing that data in an XML format. However, there may be additional work needed to make the code fully functional and suitable for specific use cases.

For instance, the current implementation only saves data to an XML file, but it may be necessary to modify the code to include additional functionality such as transmitting data over a network, using a different file format, or handling errors that may arise during data acquisition or storage.

In summary, while the code provides a starting point for accessing and storing VRPN data in an XML format, it may require additional modifications and testing to be fully functional and suitable for specific applications.
